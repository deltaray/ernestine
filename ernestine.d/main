# This file makes it easier to blacklist and do other routing operations based
# on a number that is matched. The format is like this:

# <month> <Day of month> <Day of Week> <Time> <dialed number>  <caller id number>  <route>

# Month can be 1 through 12, the name of the month or the three character
# abbreviated name (ie. Dec)

# Day of month must be numeric.

# Day of week can be 1 through 7 with 1 being Monday and 7 being Sunday. Or
# you can use the full name or three character abbreviated name.

# Time must be in HH:MM 24 time format. Unlike months and days, Time ranges do
# not include the end_time's minute. This is somewhat the natural way that
# people tend to think of time ranges and I didn't want to fight that
# instinct.
#
# Dialed number is the numeric number that the calling party dialed. This can
# include - for readability. You can also use X for match any number in that
# position.
#
# Caller id is the number of the calling party.  It can use the same rules as
# for the dialed number.
#
# Right now the expression can include the wildcards * to mean match anything.
# But nothing more sophisticated.
#
# The operation can be one of the following
#
# PASSTHRU - Do nothing, just exit and go onto the next step in the asterisk
# config for this extension.  
# HANGUP - Meaning just hangup
# PLAY(file) - Use the Asterisk Playback command to play a file.
# GOTO(context,number,priority) - Same as Asterisk Goto command.
