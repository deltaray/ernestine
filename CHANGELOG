-- Version 0.10
+ Changed the EXTENSION command to GOTO. I will add EXTENSION later
  once I implement custom rules that can take args.
+ Cleaned up subroutine code a bit. Perl subs don't need (). Doh!
+ Changed expression route processing and expression matching code
  so that it properly tokenizes the expressions instead of just
  doing a simple split. This allows for more complex expressions.
+ Added character escaping in expressions.
+ Added quoting in expressions.
+ Added CALLERNAME processing.
+ Changed ernestine.d/main example config to have a bit more
  descriptive examples and explaination of FORMAT change lines.
