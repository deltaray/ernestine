USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
This software is still considered beta. It works, but I make no guarantees that
it is well debugged and doesn't have large security holes at this time.

Also, I can't make any gaurantees that configuration formats will not change or
be backward compatible yet. I'll try to stablize the format once I get most of the
functionality in place.
