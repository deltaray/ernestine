# This file makes it easier to blacklist and do other routing operations based on
# a number that is matched. The format is like this:
# <month> <Day of month> <Day of Week> <Time>    <dialed number or expression>  <caller id number or expression>     <operations>
#
# Month can be 1 through 12, the name of the month or the three character abbreviated name (ie. Dec)
# Day of month must be numeric.
# Day of week can be 1 through 7 with 1 being Monday and 7 being Sunday. Or you can use the full name or three character abbreviated name.
# Time must be in HH:MM 24 time format. Unlike months and days, Time ranges do not include the end_time's minute. This is
#    somewhat the natural way that people tend to think of time ranges and I didn't want to fight that instinct.
#
# Dialed number is the numeric number that the calling party dialed. This can include - for readability. You can also use ? for match any number.
# Caller id is the number of the calling party.  It can use the same rules as for the dialed number.
#
# Right now the expression can include the wildcards * to mean match anything.
# But nothing more sophisticated.
#
# The operation can be one of the following
#
# PASSTHRU - Do nothing, just exit and go onto the next step in the asterisk config for this extension.
# GOTO(context,number,priority) - Like Asterisk Goto command.
#

# This next line defines how lines after will be formatted. Don't change it
# unless you want to change the format for the remainder of the file.
# Or until you define another FORMAT line in it.
# See the docs for how this line works.
